        <h2>Ginger</h2>
        <p>Ginger has been in Khya's family for 11 years, and she has become one of my greatest friends in this time! When it comes to her breed, we are still unsure (possibly Carolina Dog mix). Ginger has an outgoing personality, and loves to meet new friends when she goes on walks.</p>
        <p>When Ginger isn't sunbathing outside, you can find her hiking the trails with us, and swimming in the intercoastal here in Wilmington!</p>

        <h2>Huckleberry and Maple</h2>
        <p>Huckleberry Finn and Maple are the newest additions to the family! We found them on the streets of Charlotte, and took them in. Both of them have an adventurous personality, and love to wander the neighborhood.</p>
