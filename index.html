        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring full stack developer who found a love for coding about a month ago. Since discovering code, I have a renowned vigor for my career path. I currently work a full-time job, and I am enrolled in the Techdegree Program with Treehouse. </p>
        <p> A few of my hobbies include hiking, gaming, and collecting records! I currently live with my girlfriend Khya, our dog Ginger, and two cats Huckleberry and Maple.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I intend on completing the Treehouse Front End Web Development Program by June of 2023. With this completed, I will have the required portfolio entries needed for obtaining the Techdegree Certificate, as well as other projects I will work on leisurely.</p>
        <p>After the Front End Program, I will progress to Back End Development through Treehouse, in hopes of increasing my coding repertoire. After working hard and devoting my time to code, I will master:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to one day work for a company that helps clients get their buisness passions started, or work for a company that centers around data analysis and trends.</p>
